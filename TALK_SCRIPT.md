# Lessons learn't from moving from South Africa to New Zealand as a Software Developer

Good evening. Before I go into the actual content of this session I would like to frame what prompted me doing this session and why I'm here. Last week I did a talk at DevConf about Mob Programming and I used a quote from author Peter Block which says "The value of anothers experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."

I am going to reuse this quote for tonight. I'm not here to tell you that you need to move New Zealand, I'm here just to share my own experiences and give you hope that if this is something that you would like to try out, I've done it and this is what my experience has been like.

# My History

So a bit about me. I was born in Cape Town, spent most of my teens and twenties in Durban and have lived in Johannesburg for the last 7 years. I'm married with two little children, one five and a half and one two and a half.

From a professional side I've been priveledged to work with some of the best software professionals in South Africa. Prior to moving to New Zealand I worked for Driven Alliance in a coaching role helping team's improve how they make software. I've also been involved in the local software community, having been on the committee of SUGSA for a year, I'm one of the original founders of the DeveloperUG, having started it about 7 years ago and also started DevConf last year with Rob who some of you may know.

For the last 8 month's I've been living in Auckland in New Zealand. I work for a company called MYOB, which is product company developing software for the Accounting and Payroll Systems in Australia and New Zealand.

Over the last few months I've have had several people from South Africa approach me asking what it is like to move to New Zealand and what they should know. 

That combined with the fact that that I'm in SA for a week for DevConf, I decided to put tonight together share my experiences and what we've learn't from the move.

Now with that I want to tackle the elephant in the room. I'm not paid as a recruitor for MYOB - my primary aim of tonight it to share knowledge - I'm going to spend a bit of time at the end speaking about MYOB because they have paid for the room tonight and I believe it is a great place to work. That said, I'm going to tell it as it is both the positives and the negatives. 

# What Lifestyle is like in NZ

So with that I would like to ask a question, who here knows the total population of New Zealand since the beginning of time? Anyone like to hazzard a guess?

I was at a conference a few months ago and they asked the same questions and I was surprised to hear that the total popluation of New Zealand since the beginning of time is just over 7 million people!  That seems small, very small compared to South Africa where we are almost ten times that size.

So what does it feel like living in such a small country? 

Well, I live in Auckland which has a population of 1.4 mil and is the largest city in New Zealand by a long way - living in Auckland feels like living in a city, not a small town.

There is a city center, shops and fast food outlets.

## Traffic and Transport

Being a normal city it has the usual challenges on infrastructure - for instance, during peak hour times there is lots of congestion on the roads - the traffic in Auckland is just as bad as Johannesburg except you don't have the challenges of taxis and general disregard for rules of the road like we do in South Africa. That doesn't mean it's perfect, there are still bad drivers around - but the norm is that people wait their turn in traffic.

One of the things that did take us time to get used to was the different speeds. The maximum speed limit on open roads is only 100 km/h, and in urban areas it is only 50 km/h. The first few weeks we moved to NZ this took some getting used to, it felt like we were driving a lot slower than we should be. That said, now it feels normal and the benefit of the reduced speeds is lower fatality rates. In the last 12 months NZ had a total road fatality rate of 322 people, down from last year where at the same time they had 331 - https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/road-deaths/toll.html

Personally, I still find it amusing when I approach pedestrian crossing to see cars actually stop.

Other things related to traffic that I found different included:

* I actually haven't seen a traffic light not working since we've moved there even though we have substantially more rain than in South Africa. 
* New Zealand makes extensive use of traffic circles in urban areas
* People park their cars on the side of the road instead of in their driveways

Finally, if you are going to the city, be prepared to use public transport. Parking in the city is incredibly expensive - be prepared to spend anything from $10 to $16 per hour (which is between R100 and R160). 

### Buses & Public Transport

Public transport in Auckalnd is generally very good. In the city they have an extensive bus system, so you probably get around quicker by bus than by car and getting from urban areas to the city is also relatively easy during normal work hours as they have express busses, ferries and a reliable train system.

How much does a bus cost? If you are travelling from out of town expect to pay about $3.15 per trip.

For me we own one car, which my wife uses. I go to work each day via bus, which I enjoy because it gives me time to read while travelling to work. It's costing me about $130 per month to use the public transport system.

### Cars & Drivers Licenses

A side mention is that second hand Japanese cars are very cheap in New Zealand, so if you are on a budget you can get second hand imported cars at really good prices. I've been told that this is because New Zealand is one of the few countries near Japan that doesn't have high import charges on second hand vehicles and is also a left hand drive country. Because Japan has strict vehicle regulations, once a vehicle reaches a certain age in Japan, it is cheaper to sell it and buy a new one than maintain it - and these older vehicles end up in New Zealand.

You do not need an international drivers license to drive in New Zealand - you can use a valid South African driver license for the first year, once you have hit a year you are expected to get a New Zealand Drivers license, getting a NZ Drivers license if you already have a SA drivers license is really easy - you just need to take a eye test and fill in a form and the whole process usually takes 15 minutes to go through, and a wait of about a week before your drivers license arrives at your home via normal mail.

### Postal System

Another thing that we were pleasantly surprised with was the New Zealand mail system. It works. Most things arrive extremely quickly, and if you are ordering things from overseas like Amazon or AliExpress they are sent via normal mail system.

Before we moved to NZ I had ordered some goods from China on AliExpress and it took about 6 months to reach me - admitidly there was a postal strike going on at the time, so I'm not sure if this has changed. Ordering similar items from AliExpress in NZ takes about 2 weeks and so far I've had a 100% delivery rate.

## For those with small Children

I mentioned before that I have two small children, a 2 1/2 year old and a 5 1/2 year old. For those that have kids let me share some important information.

### Children and schools

Children start school in NZ as soon as they turn 5. That means, if your child turns 5 in the middle of the year, he/she starts school in the middle of the year. My wife knows more of the specifics of how it works, but basically they have a feeder class that new kids go to, and then at the beginning of the next year they move classes at the beginning of the year.

The way the schooling system works currently is on a decile system. You go to school typically in the area where you live. Schools are rated based on the socia-economic position of a schools student community. Schools in poorer areas get more funding from the Government than schools in areas that are wealthier. So a school rated decile 1 would be the poorest of the poor and would get substantial funding compared to a school in the decile 10 that would be the wealthiest areas. It's up to the school to do fund raising to make up the difference between what they get from Government and what they want to offer.

Our son started school and the area we stayed in at the time had two schools - one rated decile 7 and the other rated decile 4. He ended up going to the decile 4 school  because they could take him immeditely and we were amazed at the facilities and just how great the teachers were. We were pleasantly surprised. Since then we have moved areas and so Daniel has moved schools and he is now at a decile 6 school. We haven't been able to tell the difference in the standards, it's seemed pretty much the same.

At his current school we pay a 'donation' of $100 per year which is in essence the only contribution we make for his schooling.

We have found school uniforms were expensive. For Daniel's school uniform at his current school he paid $80 - $90

### Children and healthcare

Let me speak briefly about Healthcare. Healthcare for children is free. For instance, there is a portable dentist unit that travels to each school to do dentistry work, if you take your child to the doctor they will treat them for free and any emergencies are covered by the goverment healthcare system.

A quick experience to illustrate this, my niece and her family have just moved to NZ - she's 6. The first week she was in NZ she was playing in the playground and fell and broke her arm. Her mother took her to the hospital, they have a special childrens unit with really good facilities, they had the whole process with xrays, cast, doctors, etc. Everything cost them $16 which is what they paid for parking. All expenses were covered by the government. Her mother previously worked in health care in South Africa and having taken her daughter through this process her comment was that NZ Public Hospital system was better than what she has seen in our private healthcare institutions in South Africa.

In the same vein, with minor exceptions, such as cosmetic surgery, hosptial treatment is free for those eligible for health care services. You need a 2 year or more work visa to be eligible for healthcare in NZ. Hospitals care for emergencies, serious health problems and illness. Things like dentirsty and GP visits for adults are for your expense.

### Children and daycare

So, so far everything is sounding great! Here's the first challenge we found, if you have children under 3 and you want them to be in daycare you are looking at around $320 per week per child to be in DayCare. Things get a little easier once you child turns 3 because, the goverment covers 20 hours of DayCare per week per child. For our family, my wife is not working and looks after our 2 1/2 year old daughter so we don't have this expense.

### Children and playgrounds & libraries

On the plus side, Auckland is really an amazing place for children to grow up - the libraries are exceptional, they have daily activities for small children like Wiggle & Rhyme, reading time, Minecraft and in our local library they have 3D printing workshops with a 3D printer which you can use for free.

In addition the playgrounds are amazing. Auckland playgrounds are designed for people of all ages. They generally have big tube slides, often they are themed. For instance in this playground this is a life size snakes and ladders game. There are fox slides, climbing walls, swings, etc.

For us this has probably had the biggest impact on our family. When we lived in South Africa we basically felt confined to complex and while there are a few great parks they are few and far between. In Auckland every neighborhood has a park - we spend most of summer outdoors at parks in the evenings, and the parks have things like free gas braais' to cook food and are generally very well maintained.

## Housing

So far everything sounds great. Which gives me a good segeway to talk about probably the biggest challenge in Auckland which is housing. Housing is incredibly expensive. Right now the average house in Auckland will cost you over $1mil. And when I say average house, I'm talking about nothing spectacular, a 3 bedroom place in an average neighborhood and the houses are not made our of brick and mortar like we are used to. 

While we hear of crime and violance in South African news, housing prices dominate the news in New Zealand. The goverment is playing a fine balancing act trying to get more houses built without detracting investors. For instance, to curb house sales you need to put down a 20% deposit for a first time home owner - that means to just put a deposit down for a house you need about R2mil. Also, most houses are sold on auction so it is hard to do research on what a place will go for.

This puts buying a house out of the reach of many people living in Auckland which leaves renting. Again demand is outstripping supply. We have a 3 bedroom place in an average negihborhood which costs us $600 per week. We also needed to put down a 4 week deposit (basically R24 000) and you have no idea what finding a rental is like. 

Each rental property has a handful of viewing times. Viewing times are for 30 minutes. During those 30 minutes for decent places you can expect 40-50 people to look at the place, following which you have the priveledge of applying to rent and then the renter selects who they feel is the best applicant.

We looked at several places, we kept getting turned down and eventually we offered more than what they were asking for the unit as well as my wife writing a long letter explaining how good tenants we would be etc.

Now, you may think you can look and rent a place before you go over. Turns out, they are hesitant to rent a house out without people actually seeing it first, and secondly not all rentals are the same - what looks amazing online can turn out to be a real dump and visa versa. 

What we found was, as soon as you start going over the $700 per week mark demand gets less and the units get better and if you are happy to live in further out areas places are cheaper, that just leaves you with long commutes which can be tough.

I think housing is probably the biggest challenge in New Zealand and while trying to do things to make it less of an issue, it's going to be a long road before it gets sorted out. 

## Weather

Now I want to spend some time speaking about the weather. And I need to be clear that I've only lived in New Zealand since July last year. Weather depends largely on where you live in New Zealand. I spent a week in Wellington, and in Wellington they have a saying of all seasons in one day. You can have marvelous weather, but usually in a single day there will be sunshine, rain, wind. you get the idea.

Auckland is a little different. Winter is very wet, it rains a lot, but there are bursts of sunshine, so I found it bearable. Spring it still rains quite a bit, however as you reach end of November it becomes really sunny with very little rain, and our Summer has been awesome, it's very similar to Cape Town where you have these long sunny evenings. Going into March we are beginning to see more rain.

In terms of tempretaure. Before we moved to New Zealand we looked up the temperatures and it looked cold and it certainly is on the cold and wet side in Winter. That said, I was surprised to find out how pleasant lower 20's are to live in and how much warmer it was than I expected. 

## Divesity

Speak briefly about diversity.

## Having a support structure

Now I wouldn't be doing this justice unless I spoke about the biggest con of moving to Auckland. We have a great lifestyle, we really enjoy the many opportunities it has to offer yet really miss our immediate family. This photo is just my wife's family, I just couldn't find a photo for my side of the family. While it's easy to get along with associates at work you do miss your family. Skype, hangouts and all that stuff helps, but it isn't the same.

We are also fairly lucky, me and my wife are both very active in our church, and moving to New Zealand we found a lot of fellowship in a local congregation of our church. That said, looking for a support structure is really important. You need to be active about it.

So are there any general questions around lifestyle?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Local Software Community

## Meetup Events

Great, I now want to speak a bit about the local software community. New Zealand has an interesting mix of software communities. Certainly on Meetup I found a number of different developer and technology facing communities that I joined when I moved over.

I've attended a few meetup events, namely the Continous Delivery Meetup, Auckland .Net User Group, Node User Group and the Auckland Agile User Group.

You get all sorts that attend these events. The meetups that I went to were generally well attended, getting anywhere from 40 - 60 people per event depending on the topic and who's speaking.

I found the topics to be generally good and well prepared in all regards it seems like there is a passionate local developer community.

One thing that was strange to see at the meetups was most of them give people an opportunity at the beginning of each event to pitch for work, and likewise for people to pitch for hiring. This is something that was very different from what I've seen in South Africa where that is a no no.

In terms of technologies, it's much the same as South Africa. C#, Java, Node, Front End development, you name it. Also, wierdly enough I met several people who were employed as professional Delphi developers which I haven't encounterd in South Africa.

## Demographics of Software Community

Speaking about the demographics of the local software community. There is a mix of cultures, largely I've noticed Polish, French, Brazilian, South African & Indian nationalities in addition to Australians and local Kiwi's.

I think this is largely because New Zealand is encouraging immigration for the IT Sector which makes it easy for people from other countries that have challenges to get over and work, the net result being we have diverse cultures in the software community.

In fact, in the team I am in we have people of the following descent : 1 Italian, 1 Pol, 2 Indians, 1 South African, 1 Singaporian, 1 Brazilian, 2 Kiwis and from what I can see this is certainly not an exception to the norm.

The upside is you have tons of diversity.

With that of special interest is diversity of genders. New Zealand like South Africa has the same challenges of historically being a male dominated industry. There is a lot of focus on trying to make the work environment more attractive to women and encouraging women to go into software development.

## Challenges in the Software Industry

The challenges in Auckland on creating software are in many ways the same challenges we face in Johannesburg. 

* There is the microservices craze - it seems like micro services has replaced all the software industries problems with new problems
* Strong focus on test automation - in my team we are in a big drive to get to a continous delivery model. We have some great code, but we also have some really bad code that we have to still work with.
* Agile is at different levels of implementation, I speak to some organizations that are doing amazing things, and some that just don't get it

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Looking for Work

Right now there seems to be a growing demand for software developers and so getting work seems to be relatively easy.

Historically, most companies don't make job offers without having met you first. For instance there is a Facebook channel for South African's wanting to move to New Zealand and a common theme for general work is that you had to have your CV in a certain format etc. 

Personally I didn't have that as a challenge, however I knew the people where I applied and that could have played a role.

My brother-in-law who is an accountant had a very different experience. He applied for work from South Africa and got very little interest. He then came over for 4 weeks to look for work and had a very different experience. Several of the companies that had turned him down initially when he applied from South Africa re-interviewed him and he eventually took a position at a company that had originally turned him down.

That said, more and more companies are looking and interviewing software professionals remotely and trying to make it even more attractive to re-locate. 

## Covering Relocation Costs

When I applied for work 8 months ago, I covered the lion's share of the costs to re-locate including paying for a container to ship our stuff, paying for an agent to do the paper work and paying for flights to get over there. In total it probably cost me in the region of R150K

At MYOB, because we are trying to attract top talent world wide we have just adjusted a policy for people relocating so that before they leave they get

* Direct economy flights, taxis and transfers for you and any immediate family that are relocating with you
* Costs of any Visas or Work Permits   
* Travel Insurance for medical and emergency situations
* A Hotel stay for the night before you leave 
 
And then when you arrive in New Zealand or Australia you get

* Reasonable accommodation in a hotel or serviced apartment for 4-8 weeks
* Car hire for up to 8 weeks
* Reasonable costs associated with shipping personal effects
* 5 days Paid Relocation Leave 
* Reasonable costs relating to the relocation of pets which is actually quite a big deal, I don't have pets, I've heard of people who did take their pets over and it is expensive

I'm aware of other companies who are looking at similar options. Some will expect you to get over on your own steam, others will provide a re-imbursement or relocation payment once you report to work.

## Salary expectations

In terms of salary expectations - while it really depends on what you bring to the table, a senior developer will earn in Auckland around the $100K mark. In Australia, you would get 9.5% superannuation on top of that. In New Zealand, you have to have residency before you get matching contribution to your pension.

# Interview Process

So, what was my interview process like? Well - keeping in mind that different organizations have different interviewing processes, I applied at two companies. Both interview processes were very similar. Let me talk you through how it went with MYOB, and it was much the same at the other companies I applied at

First thing I did was make contact with someone who already worked at MYOB. I had known Martin Cronje through the local community and he was already working at MYOB so I sent him an email with a copy of my CV. He put me in touch with a digital talent advisor who phoned me for a chat and went through some of the info on my CV.

I then got an email from her asking me to do a coding problem - after submitting my solution, it took a few days for them to get back to me after which things progressed to an online interview which they called a cultural fit. 

A few days later there was an additioanl technical interview following which I had a team interview. Each interview took about an hour and because of the time zone differences most of the interviews happened between 11:00pm and the early hours of the morning.

Following the team interview I got a verbal offer pending reference checks and visa approval. 

All in all the whole process took about two weeks from start to getting an offer.

# Visa process

Let me stress that before I go into this I am not an immigration consultant. I have received no training and what I'm sharing should be taken as our experience - you should speak to a proper immigration consultant to confirm that my experience will be the same as yours.

## Work Visa 

After getting the verbal offer we started the process for a work visa. I was offered a 3 year work visa - we used an agent to assist us with the paper work which there is a ton of. 

The way it worked for us is they first apply for a work visa electronically for the main applicant. Only after the work visa is granted for the main applicant does the rest of the family apply for the appropriate accompanying visa's

## Health Check

The most nerve racking part of the work Visa process is passing the health check. Because in essence NZ is taking on you and your families health if anything is outside the normal range it get's referred to a doctor for review which can slow the process down significantly.

We were lucky that our medicals didn't get referred so we didn't have any major delays, for my brother in law his son is on retilin, and he did have his medical for his son referred, it delayed the process by just over a month and there is very little transparency while a medical is being referred - you basically nervously wait it out.

## Main applicant travels first

Just in terms of how it normally works, for most of the people I know the main applicant went over through to New Zealand before the rest of the family, and they followed a month or so later once their visa's were properly processed. The pro's of this is that it gives you a bit of time to find a place to stay and get the basics in order before the family arrives. The cons are you are away from the family and it can be extremely stressful on your partner who's back in South Africa.

## Applying for residency

Once we had arrived in New Zealand we applied for residency. Basically you needed to get a certain number of points to go into the pool - they have recently just upped the points requirement from 140 points to 160 points. Points are determined based on if you are on the skills shortage list, whether you have work, how educated you are and how much work experience you have in the relevant field  - every two weeks people in the pool are evaluated and those with the highest points are invited to lodge their expression of interest for residency.

### English Language Test

Before going into the pool, you need to do pass an English test. It's fairly simple but comprehensive and involves a in person interview, and about hours of examination. To do the test is going to cost R4000 per person. If English is your first language or you communicate reguarly in English you should be able to pass the test without even studying. It is basically just checking that you can speak english, and understand what others are saying to you at a normal dialog pace.

### Degree Certified

If you have a degreee and would like to use that to get additional points you first need to prove that your degree is the equivalent of a New Zealand degree. I got my degree from UNISA certified, things that they want is a detailed syllabus and original university certificate. Getting your degree certified costs about R8000 and because of the high volumes of people applying at NZ right now there is a long waiting period.

### Getting credit for Work Experience

You can also get points based on work expereince in your field. What they for you to claim that is have a letter from your former employer detailing exactly what responsbilities you performed, from what starting date to end date as well as the hours you worked. i.e. did you work an 80 hour week.

I had a letter from my employer but didin't have the hours on it, and we had to get it revised.

### Getting invited

Once you have been picked from the pool, you will be asked to supply all the supporting documents for your points allocation and get assigned a case worker. You will also be asked to pay the application fee for lodging your expression of interest which came to $550 per person.

I can't really talk you further down this process because this is where we are with our application. We are told that it takes 3 to 6 months after lodging your EOI that you get notified on whether you have been granted residency or not. At that point you no longer need a work visa or are tied to the company that applied for your work visa so it does give you some independence and peace of mind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Working at MYOB

The last part I would like to briefly talk about is where I work at, MYOB. 

I'm going to try and skip the sales pitch and give you a overall picture.

MYOB stands for mind your own business - basically we do payroll and accounting software for Australia and New Zealand.

We have development teams based in both Australia and New Zealand. With a total head count of 1400 people, and approximately 250 engineers spread across Melbourne, Syndey, Auckland and Christchurh.

Over the last few years MYOB has been going through a transformation from an software provider of desktop software to a cloud accounting solutions platform for small to mid-tier businesses in Australia and New Zealand so while we have a lot of legacy systems, we also have a lot of new stuff.

Generally at MYOB we have small teams of between 4 - 8 people. Teams are cross functional in the sense that you will have people with strong analysis, development and testing skills in a team. 

My team works on a system called our Practice Online System, which is a portal for Accoutnants wanting to oversee the state of each of their clients businesses across MYOB's accounting systems. We work closely with a team in Melbourne around the practice online system, so it is not uncommon for me or someone from my team to pop over to Australia every few months. And for instance the current tech stack we use in my team is C# for our backend services, Node as a proxy with React on the front end, so we generally are comfortable to a certain degree on Linux & Windows.

In Auckland in the Practice Online space we have a strong focus on Extreme Programming practices. Things like pair programming, Mob Programming, Test Driven Development, test automation, software craftmanship are important for us and generaly teams use practices like Scrum or Kanban as a framework to operate in.

I've found working at MYOB to be extremely satisfying. I'm working with some of the most talented engineers I have worked with up to now and we are given a lot of autonomy to figure out the best way to create software. 

That said, we are not perfect - sometimes we get things wrong. 

If you are interested in finding out more about MYOB please take a brochure, or email me and I will make sure you are put in touch with a Digital Talent Advisor.

Before we go to questions let me just finish off with the MYOB video.

{Play Video}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think what I will do is take 3 or 4 questions, and then we can call it a night.
