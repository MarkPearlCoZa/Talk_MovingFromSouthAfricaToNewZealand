# Lessons learn't from moving from South Africa to New Zealand as a Software Developer

Having recently moved from South Africa to New Zealand and now visiting SA for DevConf, several people have asked me what lessons I've learn't from this experience and to contrast my life in Johannesburg with his life in Auckland. Understanding that this topic is of particular interest to several people in our software community, I've put together an event to share what I've learn't so far. 

I'm going to cover:

What living in New Zealand is like in terms of lifestyle, what's great, and what's a challenge
What is the software community like in New Zealand, what languages and technologies are in demand
How I found work, what the interview process was like
What suggestions I would make to others looking for work in New Zealand - CV's, approaching companies online, in person interviews
How the VISA's worked - getting residency first vs. work visa (the benefits of each)
When moving, what I would take over again and what I would buy there - container vs. cube
Where I work now 
Misc Questions
