# Lessons learn't from moving from South Africa to New Zealand as a Software Developer

Good evening. Before I go into the actual content of this session I would like to frame what prompted me doing this session and why I'm here. Last week I did a talk at DevConf about Mob Programming and I used a quote from author Peter Block which says "The value of anothers experience is to give us hope, not to tell us how or whether to proceed."

I am going to reuse this quote for tonight. I'm not here to tell you that you need to move New Zealand, I'm here just to share my own experiences and give you hope that if this is something that you would like to try out, I've done it and this is what my experience has been like.

# My History

So a bit about me. I was born in Cape Town, spent most of my teens and twenties in Durban and have lived in Johannesburg for the last 7 years. I'm married with two little children, one five and a half and one two and a half.

From a professional side I've been priveledged to work with some of the best software professionals in South Africa. Prior to moving to New Zealand I worked for Driven Alliance in a coaching role helping team's improve how they make software. I've also been involved in the local software community, having been on the committee of SUGSA for a year, I'm one of the original founders of the DeveloperUG, having started it about 7 years ago and also started DevConf last year with Rob who some of you may know.

For the last 8 month's I've been living in Auckland in New Zealand. Only after moving over did I discover how many South African's actually live and work in New Zealand. At MYOB where I work I'm surrounded by South African's - I think out of about 30 people in my immediate vicinity at least 7 of them are South African.

I've have had several people from South Africa approach me over the last 8 months asking what it is like to move to New Zealand and what they should know. And that combined with the fact that there is a big recruiting drive at MYOB right now to find more talented people to join them I decided to put tonight together.

That said I'm not paid as a recruitor - my interest in promoting MYOB is purely to work with clever people and I'm going to tell you exactly what my experience has been like, both the positives and the negatives.

# What is New Zealand like

So with that I would like to ask a question, who here knows the total population of New Zealand since the beginning of time? Anyone like to hazzard a guess?

I was at a conference a few months ago and they asked the same questions and I was surprised to hear that the total popluation of New Zealand since the beginning of time is just over 7 million people!  That seems small, very small compared to South Africa where we are almost ten times that size.

So what does it feel like living in such a small country? Well, I live in Auckland which has a population of 1.4 mil

I'm going to cover:

What living in New Zealand is like in terms of lifestyle, what's great, and what's a challenge
What is the software community like in New Zealand, what languages and technologies are in demand
How I found work, what the interview process was like
What suggestions I would make to others looking for work in New Zealand - CV's, approaching companies online, in person interviews
How the VISA's worked - getting residency first vs. work visa (the benefits of each)
When moving, what I would take over again and what I would buy there - container vs. cube
Where I work now 
Misc Questions
